My-first-portfolio-template
The purpose of my project is to provide a base for beginners who are creating their first portfolio.

It is written in HTML and CSS and aims to help those who may be struggling to get started.

This project solves the problem of not having a starting point for creating a portfolio. It can be challenging to know where to begin, especially for those who are new to web development like me. This project provides a template to help others get started.

The key features of this project include a basic HTML and CSS structure for a portfolio, along with some customizations. The benefit of using this project is that it provides a solid foundation for creating a portfolio without the need to start from scratch.

The system requirements for using this project are minimal. Users only need a web browser and a text editor to make changes to the code.

To install and run the project, users can simply download the code from the GitHub repository and open it in a text editor or web browser.

The most important command or function that users should be aware of is how to customise the HTML and CSS to make the portfolio their own.

The README.md provides instructions and guidance on how to do this. There are currently no known issues or limitations with this project.

However, feedback and contributions from users are always welcome. Users can contribute to this project by submitting pull requests on the GitHub repository. They can also help by suggesting improvements or reporting any issues they encounter.
